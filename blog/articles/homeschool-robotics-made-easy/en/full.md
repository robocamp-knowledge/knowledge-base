Getting started with robotics and programming at home might feel overwhelming, especially if you don't have a tech background. But once you find your footing, it becomes a worthwhile activity you and your kids can genuinely enjoy together.

**Working on STEM projects as part of your homeschooling curriculum builds valuable skills**: breaking down problems, coming up with creative solutions, and learning to tinker and adapt. It’s not just about robots and code—it’s about building things, exploring ideas, and seeing how your kid lights up when their creation moves for the first time.

Whether you're just beginning or figuring out what tools to pick, **RoboCamp lesson plans and LEGO Education offer a path that meets you right where you are, so you and your kids can genuinely enjoy exploring programming and robotics together**.

### Who is Qualified to Teach Robotics at Home

**You are.** If robotics has caught your interest, that’s really all it takes to begin.

You don’t need a tech background to get started—just curiosity. **Educational robotics is built for beginners, so you’ll pick up what you need as you go.** At a basic level, it’s about motors that make things move, sensors that respond to the world around them, and code that ties it all together.

Beginner robots are designed to be approachable. Some come with short guides or video tutorials, but step-by-step lesson plans with clear explanations are what truly make a difference (that’s exactly why we created RoboCamp the way we did).

You can check in with homeschool groups online or lean on a structured curriculum. It’s all manageable—even if you are learning together with your students.

Don’t hold back. **With a good resource and a bit of time, you’ll grow more confident with every new build.**

### Why LEGO Sets are Perfect for Homeschooling

* LEGO sets fit homeschooling well—kids learn by building and exploring
* Kits are ready-to-use and grow with your kid by adjusting project difficulty
* RoboCamp’s step-by-step lessons give parents the confidence to teach robotics—even if they’ve never coded before

If the idea of teaching robotics and programming at home makes you pause, you're not alone. But with the right resources, what seems tricky at first often turns out to be a rewarding experience for both you and your kid.

**Because kids naturally learn by doing, LEGO sets are an ideal fit.** Through building and experimenting, they start understanding how machines work and how to control them with code. And since most kids already love playing with LEGO, there's no need to convince them to dive in—they're already halfway there. STEM becomes something they want to explore, not just another subject to check off the list.

The kits are ready to use right out of the box, with intuitive software designed for both kids and parents. A single LEGO Education set can serve multiple age groups (6–9 years and 9–12 years), simply by adjusting project complexity and programming language.

And if you already have a box of LEGO bricks at home (which many families do), you can enhance RoboCamp projects even further, extending creativity and expanding learning time without additional investment.

>"Before RoboCamp, we were guessing our way through coding lessons," said Marta, a homeschooling parent of two. "Now my kids look forward to 'robot day'—and I do, too."

With the kind of support RoboCamp offers—clear lessons, easy-to-follow instructions, and plenty of visuals—it’s much easier to feel prepared, even if this is your first time teaching anything tech-related. Whether you're just starting out or have a few years of experience under your belt, having that extra structure makes a big difference.

#### Why We Recommend Only These Two Sets for Homeschooling?

After years of hands-on work with LEGO Education, we’ve come to trust two sets above all for homeschool STEM learning: SPIKE Prime and WeDo 2.0. We’ve created more than 100 complete lesson plans for them, adding up to more than 200 hours of structured activities. Compare that with how quickly a regular LEGO set is used up—and it’s clear how much more learning and engagement these kits deliver.

**They’re not just fun; they keep kids building, thinking, and learning for months**.

We also appreciate how adaptable these sets are. **WeDo 2.0 works seamlessly with Scratch, while SPIKE Prime connects with creative tools like Tinkercad**—ideal for designing and printing 3D models or even prepping laser-cut parts. That kind of flexibility is hard to find elsewhere.

We know homeschool budgets are carefully planned. That’s exactly why we recommend these two sets—they’ve consistently offered the best value in helping kids develop real, lasting STEM skills at home.

**Are you already using a different LEGO Education set, like SPIKE Essential or LEGO MINDSTORMS?** That’s alright too, use what you have! We’ve worked with these kits for years and know how to get the most out of them. Check our lesson plans created [for SPIKE Essential](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/lessons/tag/spike-essential/#lessons) and [for MINDSTORMS](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/lessons/tag/mindstorms/) kits.

RoboCamp courses are designed to help you make the absolute best use of what you already own, so you can keep moving forward without needing to buy anything new right away.

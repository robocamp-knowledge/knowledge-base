      "heading": "Capabilities of the Set",
      "text": "## Capabilities of the set\n\nThe capabilities of Science sets need to be assessed in two ways: as a [ready-made, closed product](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/lego-science-review/#lego-science-as-an-open-product) released by LEGO Education, and as an [open set](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/lego-science-review/#lego-science-as-an-open-product) – that is, what room there is to go beyond the framework imposed by the manufacturer, whether it can be combined with other solutions and adapted to your own lesson plans.\n\n### LEGO Science as a closed product\n\nThe main value of LEGO Education Science as an **“out-of-the-box” classroom tool** lies in the ready-made lessons designed specifically for these sets. They’re structured to cover as many NGSS standards as possible, which makes the series a very convenient and predictable solution for teachers.\n\nScience teachers can use the set to guide students at all educational stages through a wide range of curriculum-required science and STEM topics. There’s no need to dive into complex issues related to coding or robotics. Models are started almost like with a magic wand – a quick tap with a card and the robot runs its sequence, neatly demonstrating the results of the experiment or simulation planned for the lesson.\n\n> Note! The ready-made lessons cover *most* topics required by NGSS, but *not all* of them.\n\nAs a **teaching aid for demonstrating specific curriculum concepts**, the LEGO Science series offers a kind of “middle ground” among LEGO Education sets. Without any programming, Science requires less time, less IT infrastructure and less tech knowledge than SPIKE, which makes it easier to adopt in a regular classroom. At the same time, thanks to a few electronic components, it’s clearly more engaging than purely mechanical BricQ Motion.\n\nThere’s no denying that **LEGO Science is very convenient for teachers who prefer screen-free science lessons**, as well as for school decision-makers. It’s ready to use straight out of the box, comes with NGSS-aligned lesson plans, and doesn’t require turning on a computer or tablet. The working method is friendly even for educators who are wary of new technologies or classroom devices.\n\nThe product delivers on promises that really matter in school:\n\n- the set contains everything students need during class,\n- it offers a base of lessons mapped to official standards,\n- it’s easy to operate,\n- it works without screens or computers,\n- and it allows you to run a complete lesson in about 45 minutes.\n\nIt also works well for cover lessons and timetable “gaps”, when you need to run an engaging activity in a single period with minimal preparation. For schools without a computer lab, LEGO Science is a reasonable option: with very little infrastructure, you can roll out consistent, repeatable science and physics lessons across different classes.\n\nAll this means that the Science series may appeal especially to teachers who, for various reasons, **have not yet used LEGO Education sets** in their lessons and are looking for a safe, structured starting point.\n\nHowever, you should also be aware of the downsides.\n\nThe elements in the box are selected strictly with specific lessons in mind; their goal is not to support students’ creative engineering. Mechanisms are simplified and often less interesting than models built from sets richer in construction pieces. **The narrow framework of the series also affects lesson quality** – restricted possibilities in terms of construction, electronics and programming mean that models are quite symbolic. After a few lessons, you may find that holding students’ attention still depends mostly on the teacher’s creativity and teaching style.\n\nRobotics clubs and project teams will feel the lack of programming and limited freedom in building. For this type of work – long-term projects, competitions, advanced robotics – SPIKE will be a much better fit (even if you sometimes use it in simple offline demonstration mode). The constraints of LEGO Science also make it a poor choice for multi-lesson projects where students should iterate and develop their own designs.\n\nIn short: **LEGO Science is an interesting proposal for teaching, but it is not a universal tool**. It shines as a structured, screen-free demonstration kit, not as a platform for open-ended robotics and engineering.\n\n(LEGO Science Bricks comparison: decorative elements vs mechanical)\n\n### LEGO Science as an open product\n\nIf you want to use LEGO Science differently than strictly as prescribed by the producer – for example, as an open-ended STEM or robotics kit – the sets start to look like rather difficult partners.\n\n**On the construction side, you are strongly limited by the very small number of Technic elements.** This makes it harder not only to build complex mechanisms, but even solid, stable versions of simple ones (for example, the lack of black friction pins means that models tend to have noticeable play). There’s very little room for students’ engineering creativity. They can only use their imagination when decorating – which is supported by smooth tiles, ornamental elements and minifigures – so even simple models can look attractive, but mechanically they remain basic.\n\n**The huge plus, of course, is the lack of cables.** This lets you focus on the model’s functionality instead of how to route wires, and it also improves the look of the finished builds. However, you need to remember that the nature of this electronics requires that all elements have easy access to the power button and room for the card to be placed against them. This practical detail can limit where and how you integrate motors or sensors into your models.\n\nAnother major limitation to the set’s potential comes from the **preprogrammed movements of Science electronics.** Take the motors as an example. By default, the factory program controlling the motor lets the head move over a full 360-degree range. which makes it impossible, for example, to build robots with motion limiters. That makes it impossible to build robots with motion limiters, which are useful in launchers, grippers or barrier mechanisms – such constructions would simply pull themselves apart when turned on. Also, you can’t build many interactive models, because specific readings from the color sensor always trigger the same reactions in the motors.\n\nFortunately, these problems can be worked around by programming directly in the [Coding Canvas app](). This online tool allows fairly precise control over the electronics and lets you connect many electronic components at once. However, we’re holding off on a final verdict on this app – first, the RoboCamp team will design several new robots to test its capabilities in real classroom and club conditions.\n\nOf course, we should also underline that **opening LEGO Science up to programming from the app completely undermines the intended working model – screen-free, offline** science lessons that don’t require devices.\n\nSo is it worth buying this set at all?",
      "summary": "The chapter evaluates LEGO Education Science in two frames: as a closed, ready-made product with manufacturer lessons, and as an open set used beyond the prescribed framework. As a closed product, it emphasizes NGSS-aligned lesson coverage, screen-free operation, and the claim of running a complete lesson in about 45 minutes, while also noting that the ready-made lessons cover most NGSS topics but not all. As an open product, it describes constraints from a very small number of Technic elements, practical build requirements such as access to power buttons and card placement, and limitations from preprogrammed motor behavior like a full 360-degree range that breaks motion limiter designs. It also notes that programming in Coding Canvas can work around some issues, while undermining the intended device-free model.",

      "text": "## Conclusions: Is LEGO Science for you\n\n**TOP 3 PROS**\n\n- 40 ready-made 45–60 minute lessons from LEGO Education\n- alignment with NGSS standards\n- screen-free, offline learning\n\n**TOP 3 CONS**\n\n- rigid set, limited capabilities\n- high price\n- suboptimal group work model\n\nThe greatest advantages of the LEGO® Education Science line are its ready-made, NGSS-aligned lesson plans and the ability to run completely screen-free, offline science lessons. It’s a solid choice for teachers who want to easily enrich their science curriculum with group work and hands-on experiments that help students grasp specific, clearly defined topics from the US standards – without spending hours on preparation.\n\nThis **tool may appeal especially to early primary school math and science teachers** who would like to add a few more engaging, brick-based lessons during the school year, but feel unsure about coding or managing tablets and laptops in the classroom. The manufacturer’s lessons are designed to fit into a 45-minute period, and some of them can be adapted to school standards other than NGSS.\n\nLEGO Science is also well thought out from the perspective of **school budget decision-makers**. One product contains everything a teacher and student need: bricks, electronics, and teaching materials. There’s nothing else you have to buy – no extra tablets, laptops, or additional resources to get started with screen-free STEM lessons.\n\n**However, Science is a very rigid system.** The choice of elements and the default exclusion of programming mean that working freely beyond the ready-made lesson framework is difficult, which significantly limits its broader application in school and cools students’ creative ambitions.\n\nThe Science kits will work in your school if you plan to use the sets primarily in the role defined by the manufacturer. In that case, they bring real value and can be a sensible choice. But it’s important to remember that this is not an all-purpose robotics set – it is not designed for teaching programming or developing deep student independence and creativity in engineering. **In practice, LEGO Science is very good at one specific thing: repeatable, screen-free lessons based on ready-made scenarios.** For projects, coding and competitions, [SPIKE](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/lego-spike-essential-review/) is the better choice.\n\nIf you’ve already worked with SPIKE before and expect LEGO Education Science to “work similarly”, you may be disappointed: Science doesn’t offer programming or comparable engineering freedom.",
      "summary": "The conclusions section lists three pros (40 ready-made 45–60 minute lessons, NGSS alignment, and screen-free offline learning) and three cons (a rigid set with limited capabilities, a high price, and a suboptimal group work model). It states the product may suit early primary math and science teachers who want ready-made group activities without managing tablets or coding, and it frames the set as containing bricks, electronics, and teaching materials with no extra devices required. The chapter also emphasizes that Science is not designed for teaching programming and that using it beyond the manufacturer’s lesson framework is difficult, recommending SPIKE instead for projects, coding, and competitions. It warns that teachers expecting Science to work like SPIKE may be disappointed due to limited engineering freedom.",

      "text": "### Science vs other LEGO Education sets\n\nIn terms of construction possibilities, Science sets don’t hold a candle to the decent (though mechanically modest) [SPIKE Essential](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/lego-spike-essential-review/) or the fantastic [SPIKE Prime](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/lego-spike-prime-review/). BricQ Motion is also richer in construction elements – there you have sails, weights, fan blades, many types of gears and beams, pins and all sorts of connectors. **Science includes fewer construction bricks, and they are less universal.**\n\n**Science electronics are modest** and less useful didactically compared to SPIKE Prime and SPIKE Essential – although this matters less if you’re not interested in teaching programming at all.\n\nScience’s main advantage seems to be **the ability to work offline without a screen.** But note – this is also possible with SPIKE Prime! Each Prime hub comes with factory-loaded demo programs that, with the addition of teaching materials and printed building instructions, could easily become a tool for screen-free work. It’s a pity LEGO did not think of selling such an add-on separately for the sets that already exist.\n\nA real advantage of Science electronics is **the lack of cables** connecting the components in a model – and yes, it does look nicer. It potentially removes some construction constraints for builders, but they are not the main target group. The need to charge all these elements, however, can quickly become tiresome.\n\n**Because of the intrinsic limitations of the line, students have fewer opportunities to learn through play during lessons.** Science does not allow them to run their own tests and experiments – there’s neither enough bricks nor time. The lessons don’t really include room for creativity beyond adding a few decorations.\n\nCompared to the capabilities of other LEGO Education products, it is hard to shake the impression that **the Science line focuses more on teacher expectations than on student potential.**",
      "summary": "The comparison argues that Science sets offer fewer and less universal construction bricks than SPIKE Essential, SPIKE Prime, and BricQ Motion, which is described as richer in elements like gears, beams, pins, and connectors. It states that Science electronics are more modest and less useful didactically than SPIKE Prime and SPIKE Essential, while still highlighting a cable-free build as a practical advantage. The chapter notes that offline screen-free work is presented as Science’s main advantage but adds that SPIKE Prime hubs include factory-loaded demo programs that could also support screen-free work with appropriate materials. It also links the line’s limitations to reduced opportunities for students to run their own tests and experiments due to time and brick constraints.",

      "text": "### Price and value of LEGO Science\n\nThe price of a Science set ranges from 329.95 USD to 499.95 USD. To cover the full student journey (ages 5–14), you need to buy all 3 sets, which comes to 1,229.85 USD.\n\nSPIKE Essential costs 329.95 USD. SPIKE Prime is 399.95 USD. Together they cover a similar, longer age range (6 to 16+) and cost 729.90 USD in total.\n\nBricQ Motion sets are the cheapest – both BricQ Motion Prime and Essential cost only 159.95 USD, but they don’t include any electronics.\n\n(Price comparison: LEGO Science vs LEGO SPIKE)\n\nThe overall **value of LEGO Science is debatable**. The contents of the box don’t really justify such a high price, especially when you consider that the lesson plans and teaching outlines are freely available to everyone on LEGO’s online platform. It’s possible that part of the cost of developing the lessons and the Teacher Portal has simply been built into the set price. Or perhaps this product is intentionally designed to be **high-convenience rather than low-cost**.\n\n**Science “pays off” when your top priorities are: truly screen-free work, easy teacher onboarding and ready-made lessons aligned with NGSS.** It makes less financial sense when your main focus is the development of engineering skills, mechanics or coding – in that case, the price-to-capability ratio is clearly better in the SPIKE line.\n\nSince the series has only just entered the market, we don’t yet know whether it will turn out to be a long-term investment. We can only hope that, like other LEGO Education sets, these kits will prove durable – some WeDo 1.0 robotics sets from 2009 are still being used in schools today.",
      "summary": "The chapter states that LEGO Science sets cost 329.95–499.95 USD and that buying all three kits for ages 5–14 totals 1,229.85 USD. It compares this with SPIKE Essential (329.95 USD) plus SPIKE Prime (399.95 USD) totaling 729.90 USD while covering ages 6 to 16+, and it notes that BricQ Motion Prime and Essential cost 159.95 USD each but include no electronics. It argues the value is debatable because lesson plans and teaching outlines are freely available on LEGO’s platform and suggests part of the price may reflect lesson and Teacher Portal development.

      "text": "LEGO Science is an interesting product that brings several noteworthy innovations. **Its real strength lies in how easy it is to implement in school and how tightly it integrates with the American NGSS science curriculum**, which is not necessarily an ideal match for all educational systems around the world. **In terms of capabilities, educational value and price-to-content ratio, the Science series loses to LEGO Education sets that are already on the market.**\n\nIt’s also striking that **LEGO Education Science often seems to contradict itself**. The set is meant to be used primarily by children, yet the marketing and design decisions appear to focus more on adult expectations. It promotes screen-free lessons, while quietly releasing a programming app in the background. It claims to foster student creativity, while clearly limiting their options for building and coding. It looks visually modest, yet is currently the most expensive LEGO Education set.\n\nEven so, the Science line will certainly find its fans. The ability to skip programming, avoid managing tablets and roll out ready-made, screen-free lessons quickly can convince a completely new group of teachers to try LEGO bricks in the classroom for the first time.\n\nFor schools that want to introduce LEGO Education gradually, **Science can be a low-risk first step**: start with structured, offline science lessons and only later move on to SPIKE when staff and students are ready for coding and more open-ended engineering. In this role, LEGO Science becomes less a competitor to SPIKE and more a **gateway to richer STEM and robotics tools**, especially in schools where technology access, teacher confidence or preparation time are still limited.\n\nIn other contexts, LEGO Science will simply be the **“good enough” answer** – a way to tick the boxes of hands-on STEM, NGSS alignment and screen-free activities without reshaping the timetable or investing in new infrastructure. For schools that already use SPIKE or BricQ Motion, it will more likely remain a niche add-on than a central tool.\n\nThe key is to see Science for what it really is: **not a universal solution for robotics and programming, but a specialized kit for fast, ready-made science lessons with LEGO bricks**.\n\n<br>",

It highlights multiple contradictions, including promoting screen-free lessons while releasing a programming app and claiming to foster creativity while limiting building and coding options, alongside a modest visual design paired with the highest price among LEGO Education sets. The chapter presents implementation scenarios where Science serves as a low-risk first step for schools before moving to SPIKE when staff and students are ready for coding and more open-ended engineering.

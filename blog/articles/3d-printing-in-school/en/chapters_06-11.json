      "text": "### Selected 3D models for STEAM lessons we tried ourselves\n\nOur team combed through online 3D model databases to find some interesting projects for various school subjects. We tested them ourselves, then rated their difficulty on a scale from easy (⭐) to very demanding (⭐⭐⭐).\n\nTotal print time and PLA filament usage were estimated with optimal settings for the Flashforge Adventurer 4 printer. One meter of 1.75 mm PLA filament weighs about 2.98 grams, and a 1 kg spool contains approximately 335 meters.\n\n**Biology**\n\nIndeed, with a 3D printer you can print a model of an animal or plant cell and show it to students. For biology and nature lessons, you can print much more: models of internal organs, bones, or even a complete skeleton – life-sized! Of course, this requires a lot of time, and if you care about anatomical accuracy, the print settings must be perfectly calibrated.\n\n(3D printed model for school: cell)\n\nInterestingly, such models are increasingly being used at universities too, alongside real specimens.\n\n- [Plant cell](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-multi-color-mini-plant-cell-60821) ⭐⭐ – print time: 4 hr 40 min; filament: 17.5 m; other supplies: glue;\n- [Animal cell](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2803322) ⭐⭐ – print time: 4 hr; filament: 12.5 m; other supplies: glue;\n- [Human heart model](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-anatomical-heart-34709) ⭐⭐ – print time: 15 hr; filament: 13.02 m;\n- [Human skull model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4830026) ⭐⭐⭐ – print time: ~40+ hr; filament: 165 m; other supplies: glue, magnets, drill;\n\n**Mathematics**\n\n3D props can be used to illustrate math principles – especially geometry. When students struggle to visualize a solid in space, like a regular icosahedron, just hand them one.\n\n- [Regular icosahedron](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1343285/files) ⭐ – (300% scale) print time: 30 min; filament: 2 m;\n- [Pythagorean theorem](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:245202/) ⭐⭐ – print time: 3 hr; filament: 11 m;\n\n**Geography**\n\n(3D printed model for school: map of Europe)\n\nThe Earth isn’t flat – which is definitely worth showing students. Our planet’s landscape is highly diverse, and its canyons, volcanoes, cliffs, and other natural features can be illustrated with 3D props.\n\n- [Volcanoes of the world](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1316498) ⭐ – print time: ~30 min to 3 hr each; filament: ~1.5 m to 11 m each\n- [Topographic map of Europe](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5147240) ⭐⭐ – (80% scale) print time: 4 hr 20 min; filament: 8 m;\n- [Grand Canyon erosion](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2709566) ⭐⭐⭐ – base print time: 12 hr; filament: 29 m PLA + 10 m PVA; other supplies: 2L bottle, craft knife, screwdriver, tape;\n\n**Physics**\n\nAlthough physics deals with the fundamental interactions and properties of our world, learning it often boils down to theory alone. With 3D props, you can show that physics is all around us, and that its theories are based on real phenomena. And if we’re in the mood to introduce students to the cosmos while undertaking a really ambitious project, you can print and assemble a model of the Solar System.\n\n- [Balancing bird](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-spinning-balancing-bird-6401) ⭐⭐ – print time: 2 hr 35 min; filament: 7 m;\n- [Solar System](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-model-solar-system-5505) ⭐⭐ – print time: 35+ hr; filament: ~25 m;\n- [Sun–Earth–Moon Planetarium](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3928677/files) ⭐⭐⭐ – print time: 35+ hr; filament: ~21 m; other supplies: screws and nuts;\n\n**History**\n\n(3D printed model for school: paleolithic hand axe)\n\nAmong 3D printing enthusiasts, there are many fans of ancient and modern history, thanks to whom we have lots of high-quality ready-made models. The highly detailed ones usually cost money, but are often worth it – especially to see students marvel at the ingenuity of their ancestors.\n\n- [Statue of Sekhmet](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-sekhmet-96018) ⭐ – print time: 3 hr 10 min; filament: 11 m\n- [Paleolithic hand axe](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-stone-handaxe-81793) ⭐⭐ – print time: 6 hr; filament: 19 m;\n- [Colosseum](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:962416/) ⭐⭐ – print time: 18 hr 30 min; filament: 36 m;\n\n**Art**\n\nAlthough 3D printers are more associated with engineering than art, when combined with design software, they can be effectively used to create original works. Moreover, you can print famous sculptures, monuments, and reliefs – much to the surprise of ancient masters.\n\n- [Easter Island Moai](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-moai-head-on-easter-island-200530) ⭐ – print time: 2 hr; filament: 6 m;\n- [Famous Parisian buildings](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:311002) ⭐ – print time: 30 min to 4 hr 30 min each; filament: 0.7 m to 11 m each;\n- [Bust of Helena](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-plaster-bust-of-helen-124529) ⭐⭐ – (50% scale) print time: 5 hr; filament: 14.2 m;",

They can work on it individually or in groups, but the designing part is a solo assignment. Completed digital models are sent to the teacher, who prints them out and returns the results to the authors for testing. If necessary, students revise their designs and resubmit them for printing. The printed model makes it possible to complete the initial task.\n\n**Students solve the problem using the knowledge they’ve gained and their own ideas. They observe how the three-dimensional digital object they created transforms into a real, tangible item they can hold in their hands.** The result? A guaranteed increase in student motivation and sense of agency.\n\nThis is what a model lesson using 3D design might look like. Unfortunately, putting it into practice at school isn’t always easy – especially with technical limitations like long print times getting in the way.\n\nThere are more challenges, and good intentions alone won’t solve them all.",

      "text": "### Advantages\n\n#### High educational value\n\nUsing a 3D printer to teach 3D design makes maximum educational use of the equipment in a school setting (whether it's a public school, a makerspace, or a STEM center). Students get a real chance to experience the possibilities of a 3D printer – even if it’s the [teacher who prints the projects](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#how-to-prepare-for-working-with-a-3d-printer).\n\nWhen designing in 3D, students must become familiar with a virtual work environment and learn how to use its many functions. It includes elements of mathematics and develops spatial imagination. The combination of design and 3D printing helps students understand the difference between a digital project and a physical print, as well as the technological limitations of 3D printing.\n\nFinally, it’s worth adding that this is a unique opportunity for a student to confront their innovative vision with reality.\n\n#### Developing future-ready competencies\n\nFuture competencies are important – especially for students. It’s hard to predict exactly what qualifications will be in demand on the job market in a dozen or so years, but 21st-century skills will certainly help future employees perform tasks in the work environment – and employers are well aware of this.\n\n**During 3D design classes, students acquire practical skills that are in demand on the global job market.** They learn the basics of 3D design, use abilities from various fields at once, work in a virtual environment, and solve complex problems. They develop independence, abstract and critical thinking, and they also get the chance to experiment and draw logical conclusions.\n\n3D design projects also build future-ready competencies tied to career and technical education (CTE), giving students early exposure to digital fabrication and problem-solving in engineering contexts.df\n\n#### Supporting creativity\n\n(Teacher using 3D printer)\n\nSociety increasingly values out-of-the-box thinking, but developing this skill at a public school is not easy. To foster creativity, one must actively create physical models. 3D design enables this – and at relatively low cost.\n\nA dedicated 3D lab isn’t necessary – a computer lab where each student works at their own desktop or laptop is enough. For materials, just a few spools of filament in different colors will do. Mistakes aren’t costly, they can be freely corrected, and models can be improved and personalized.\n\nAll of this is within reach – the only requirement is getting comfortable with the creative process in a digital environment.",
      "summary": "The chapter presents 3D design as a high-value way to use school 3D printers because students learn in a virtual environment, connect design with printing, and understand differences between digital projects and physical outputs. It argues that these classes build future-ready competencies and CTE-related skills, including problem-solving, independence, abstract thinking, and experimentation, while reflecting employer interest in 21st-century skills. It also highlights creativity benefits, noting that a computer lab and a few spools of filament can support iterative work where mistakes are inexpensive and designs can be improved or personalized.",

      "heading": "Disadvantages of 3D Design in School",
      "text": "### Disadvantages\n\n#### Specialist qualifications and experience\n\nParticipating in 3D design classes sounds magical, but conducting them is a whole different story. Not every teacher can handle it – mainly due to the required knowledge and experience.\n\nThe absolute minimum is being computer-literate at the level of confident everyday use and being open to new technologies. You don’t have to be a digital native, but basic knowledge is essential. One must get well acquainted with the design software and slicer, understand their functions, parameters, and common errors. As if that weren’t enough, the teacher must know the school’s 3D printer inside out – how to operate it, how to deal with troubleshooting, how to adjust settings to print the best possible model.\n\n**All in all, this is truly a large amount of practical knowledge, most of which you acquire by designing and working with the equipment.** It takes a lot of personal determination – and even more time.\n\n#### Lack of teaching materials\n\nThe shortage of teaching aids is another reason why special preparation is necessary to lead 3D design lessons.\n\n**So far, a universal educational path for 3D design at the primary school level had not yet been developed.** A few educational resources have been created on the topic of learning design, but mostly in the context of higher education and vocational training. Lesson plans and ideas created by other teachers can be found online, but they vary in quality, difficulty, and are made for specific conditions. They need to be reviewed, and often also modified to suit your lesson’s needs. The lack of ready-made materials means the teacher is also responsible for creating the entire curriculum practically from scratch.\n\n#### High effort, high commitment\n\n3D design classes take more time and effort than it might seem at first glance.\n\n**The teacher, apart from preparing and drafting the course plan themselves, is also responsible for operating the 3D printer – in other words, printing all the models.** Most likely after school hours. Not every print will come out right the first time; some will have to be repeated.\n\nLet's put this in real time. Assuming you’re teaching a group of 12 students and work on relatively small projects, and it takes each model an average of 2 hours to print, that’s an entire weekend with the 3D printer running. For real examples of print times, [check out the 3D Props section](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#selected-3d-models-for-steam-lessons-we-tried-ourselves) in this article.\n\nThe students don’t have it easy either. The idea of designing and printing their own toy car sounds exciting, but fine-tuning the project over several weeks so that it actually works and can be printed at all is difficult and... boring. **Long stretches of designing without tangible results become routine for kids and sap their motivation.** On the other hand, designing overly simple models is counterproductive – who would be interested in them? What problem would they help solve?\n\nBalancing between dull simplicity and unattainable virtuosity, the teacher must somehow create lessons that are both engaging and achievable at the same time.",
      "summary": "The chapter explains that teaching 3D design requires specialist qualifications, including comfort with design software, slicers, common errors, and detailed knowledge of operating and troubleshooting the school’s 3D printer. It highlights a lack of universal primary-level curricula and teaching materials, forcing teachers to review, modify, or create lesson plans and course structures themselves. The workload is amplified by printing responsibilities that often occur after school hours, and the chapter gives an example where 12 students and 2-hour prints can consume an entire weekend. It also notes student-side challenges, where long periods of designing without tangible results can become boring and reduce motivation.",

      "text": "## 3D Robotics – Designing Parts for Robots\n\n(Robots with 3D printed parts designed by RoboCamp)\n\nCombining educational robotics with 3D design makes a lot of sense from both an educational and organizational standpoint. Introducing a 3D printer simultaneously enriches robotics lessons and simplifies teaching 3D design in school conditions.\n\nIt also helps overcome several of the [earlier challenges](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#disadvantages_1) and brings some unexpected **advantages to the classroom**:\n\n- Short print times, faster results\n- Simple for students, stress-free for teachers\n- No boredom, just building\n- Every lesson ends with something that works\n- Real-world skills with a future focus (CTE)\n\n**Here's how it works.** Teacher conducts a standard robotics lesson that covers introduction, building, testing, and programming the robot. In addition, students receive step by step instructions on how to design a 3D element that allows the robot to perform a special task. Once completed, 3D projects are sent to the teacher, who prints them and hands them back to the students for testing with the robot.\n\n{{ macro.embed_youtube('NCaoEN_z6fg') }}\n\nOne project might involve building and programming a butterfly out of LEGO® bricks, then designing and printing wings with a unique pattern, or one that's characteristic for a particular species.\n\nNext time, students might build a wind turbine mechanism from bricks and design a unique rotor for it in the 3D environment, which they then print and test for efficiency. Each project can be divided into several shorter lessons.\n\n#### Short printing time\n\nChildren design an element meant to solve a specific (tangible) problem outlined in the project. The complexity level of the projects is adapted to the students’ age. Since the robots are not large, the required elements are also small, which shortens printing time.\n\n#### Easy learning for students, easy prep for teacher\n\nAt each stage, both the **teacher and students have access to detailed step-by-step instructions, which makes learning the software faster and easier**, and mistakes occur less frequently. The teacher also has access to a ready-made project, which they can use if needed.\n\n#### No monotony\n\nWhat’s more, **combining robotics and 3D design prevents students’ motivation from being exhausted by problems related to aesthetics and monotony**. Designing alone can become tedious because you spend hours in a virtual environment before seeing a tangible result (which may not necessarily look the way you imagined).\n\n#### Every lesson ends with a success\n\nIn robotics with elements of design, even if the model turns out a bit crooked, the child still has an aesthetic proof of their hard work – a functioning robot. That’s something to be proud of! When design is part of a larger project, one that you partially create in a virtual environment but also build with our own hands, there’s no room for boredom.\n\n#### Developing relevant CTE skills\n\nWhat do students learn in such lessons? Programming, spatial imagination, manual skills, elements of STEAM, 3D design, problem-solving, group work, independent work, creativity... and much more.\n\n(RoboCamp robot made with LEGO bricks and 3D printed parts)\n\n**Combining robotics and 3D design is a great convenience for the teacher and an attainable way for students to use the 3D printer.** One project can be carried out over several consecutive lessons. Thanks to the multimedia step-by-step instructions, everyone knows what and how to do, which significantly simplifies learning. And once printed, you can keep the models for working with the next group.\n\nDo you think it's worth trying out with your students?\n\nAll step by step instructions, as well as downloadable models are available on the RoboCamp platform.

      "text": "## How to prepare for working with a 3D printer\n\n(Teacher operating 3D printer)\n\n3D printing in schools can be integrated in several ways – whether as a [prop-making tool](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#3d-props-for-lessons), a platform for [teaching design](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#3d-design) skills, or as [part of robotics lessons](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#3d-robotics-designing-parts-for-robots). Each approach comes with its own advantages and challenges. Whichever path you choose, proper preparation for working with a 3D printer is essential.\n\n#### Attend model-specific 3D printer training\n\nFirst of all, **if you get the chance, definitely take part in a training session on how to use your 3D printer.** Ideally, it should focus specifically on the model you have at school.\n\nThe training should cover all the basics: how to get the printer started, how to use the software, which settings and parameters matter, the different types of filament, and so on. After a solid training session, you should feel comfortable loading and changing filament, printing a model from a file, and even fixing small issues on your own. And of course, reading the printer’s manual won’t hurt either.\n\n#### Learn by doing: practice printing often\n\n**Training provides valuable knowledge, but you learn most by working with the equipment on our own. That’s why you should print, print, print!**\n\nDon’t wait for a pretext to use the 3D printer to appear on its own – come up with one today. Find an impressive model you want to place on your desk, level the printer bed, see how the extruder and nozzle work.\n\nAlways ensure basic safety practices, such as operating the printer in a well-ventilated area and supervising use when the equipment is heated or in motion. Sooner or later something will clog, instead of a pyramid model you’ll print spaghetti, and an error message will pop up on the screen – and each time you’ll learn something new. Remember that a 3D printer is, above all, a tool – not a showpiece – and it was made to be used.\n\n#### Start with proven educational materials\n\nOnce you’ve gotten comfortable with the printer and slicer, start with ready-made educational materials. There will be plenty of time later to bring your own creative ideas to life. **Begin with lesson plans and resources that others have already tested** (e.g. [RoboCamp lesson plan for Butterfly with 3D printed wings](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/lessons/spike-3d/)) – it’s a smart way to boost your chances of success, save time (and nerves), and get a sense of what actually works in a classroom setting. Wait to develop your own materials until you feel confident using the printer.\n\nMistakes happen and will continue to happen, but thanks to your earlier experience, you’ll know what went wrong.\n\n#### Prepare mentally: be patient, flexible, and open to help\n\nFinally, the most important thing – prepare yourself mentally. Be ready for mistakes, for not knowing things, for occasional panic, and for hours spent watching filament being laid down. **Be patient, be forgiving with yourself and with the imperfections of advanced technological equipment. Give yourself time.**\n\nBe prepared for the fact that your students – digital natives – may sometimes know more than you do, and their advice may turn out to be helpful. Appreciate their interest. Be ready for the lack of knowledge among your colleagues, who don’t use the 3D printer and don’t understand why some things just can’t be printed. Explain it to them, invite them to collaborate. Maybe they’ll help?\n\nAs you keep printing regularly, you’ll start to see real progress. Your prints will look better, you’ll feel confident enough to try more complex projects, and the fear will fade – because by then, you’ll understand how the printer works and how to handle minor hiccups on your own. You might even find yourself giving helpful tips to other teachers and students about how to get the best results. Before you know it, word gets around: you’re the school’s 3D printing expert. Congratulations!\n\nIt’s all within reach – but let’s be honest: it takes time, patience, and a good amount of motivation.\n\n[(Lesson plans for LEGO SPIKE Prime)](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/lessons/)",

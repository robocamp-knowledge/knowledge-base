      "text": "3D printers are becoming increasingly common in schools across North America, especially in STEM labs, makerspaces, and technology classrooms. Many schools already have the equipment set up, filaments waiting in storage, and at least one enthusiastic teacher who has taken the lead on managing 3D printing activities. In theory, everything is ready.\n\n**But how can this equipment be used effectively during actual lessons with students?**\n\nUnfortunately, clear guidance on the practical classroom use of 3D printing is still limited. While the hardware may be available, many schools are still figuring out how to integrate it into daily teaching – what kind of preparation is needed, what educational materials to use, and what 3D printing in everyday school practice should really look like.\n\nThat’s why in this article, based on our own experiences and academic work published by educators from around the world over the past few years, we analyze how 3D printing can truly be used in primary school – what the real possibilities and educational limitations of a 3D printer are.\n\nRead on to discover what’s possible with a 3D printer in the classroom. Explore the advantages and challenges of different teaching approaches – and get a taste of how your lesson with a 3D printer could look like, challenges included.\n\n**If you want to start using your school’s 3D printer, this article is for you.**",

      "text": "## Myths About 3D Printing in School\n\n(Myths about 3D printing)\n\nA few seconds online is enough to find tons of articles describing the many advantages and supposedly endless possibilities of 3D printers. Usually, these are marketing texts sponsored by manufacturers. Few of them discuss the limitations of these devices, let alone problem-solving.\n\nThat’s why before you read about ways to use a 3D printer in school, we need to dispel a few popular myths.\n\n#### 3D Printing is fast, easy, and educational\n\n**The printing process is neither educational, nor fast, nor trouble-free.** Regardless of the printer model. Printing a single 3D model takes a long time, even if the process is easy to understand. Having students watch the entire printing process is unnecessary – actually, it is discouraged.\n\nWhat’s more, you have to reckon with the fact that not every print will work the first time, even if the project is flawless. The nozzle can clog, the model can detach from the print bed, a layer can print incorrectly… In most cases, the error has to be diagnosed, fixed, and the model printed again from scratch.\n\n#### 3D printer is student equipment\n\nA 3D printer is primarily a tool for the teacher, not the student. This is a natural consequence of the long print times and the responsibility for operating and maintaining the equipment.\n\nSo if a school plans to let students operate the 3D printer on their own, e.g. as part of an extracurricular club, it is worth considering purchasing two cheaper units instead of one more advanced machine.\n\n#### Everyone is ready for 3D printing in school\n\nFirst, not every school has immediate access to 3D printers. Accessibility is improving year by year, but still, it varies greatly throughout the North America. Fortunately grants, partnerships, and shared lab spaces are making them increasingly attainable.\n\nSecond, some schools have a 3D printer and simply don't use it. **The educational possibilities of 3D printers are indeed valuable, however they have not yet been adapted to mainstream education.** There is a lack of high-quality materials, a tried-and-true curriculum, textbooks, training, and even lesson plans – right now, nearly everything falls on the teacher’s shoulders.\n\nThere are lots of 3D models, but they are scattered across different repositories and vary in quality, so finding the right model for a lesson also takes a lot of time.\n\n#### Teachers will motivate themselves\n\nSupport for teachers working with this equipment is very important. Initial enthusiasm inevitably wanes in the face of real difficulties with using a 3D printer, like time needed to prepare lessons, failed prints, maintenance, troubleshooting, the learning curve of this technology... And let’s remember, the teacher plays a key role here.\n\n**To make 3D printing really accessible for students, teachers need administrative support, access to professional development, but also straightforward everyday motivation that comes from people around them.**\n\nIt’s worth encouraging more than one teacher in a school to use the printer – peer support and the opportunity to compare experiences are cited by teachers as some of the most important motivations for continuing 3D printing projects.\n\n#### Students will achieve better academic results\n\nThose directly involved in classes with a 3D printer (teachers and students) notice an increase in motivation and engagement at the beginning, but **there is still a lack of reliable data on the relationship between the use of this equipment and measurable academic progress**. The studies published so far involve small groups and do not account for mainstream education. The most optimistic forecasts come from printer manufacturers – but that’s probably no surprise.\n\n**The truth is that a 3D printer in a school setting is a tool with great potential, but it’s hard to predict how it will perform with your students – a lot depends on how exactly you use it.**\n\nNow you can consider how you want to use this tool in practice. There are  two obvious directions: [printing props](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#3d-props-for-lessons) and [learning design](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#3d-design).\n\nIf you're already familiar with them, skip ahead to [3D robotics](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#3d-robotics-designing-parts-for-robots) – our take on combining educational robotics with 3D design in a way that's easier to achieve in school.",
      "summary": "The chapter argues that many online texts about 3D printing are manufacturer-sponsored marketing and rarely address limitations or problem-solving. It states printing is not fast, trouble-free, or inherently educational, and watching the entire print is unnecessary and discouraged, with failures such as nozzle clogs or model detachment requiring diagnosis and reprinting. It also says the printer is mainly a teacher tool due to long print times and maintenance responsibility, and notes access and adoption vary while mainstream-ready curricula, training, and lesson plans are lacking, leaving much on teachers’ shoulders.",

      "heading": "3D Props for Lessons",
      "text": "## 3D Props for Lessons\n\n(Models 3D printed by RoboCamp team)\n\nWherever in the world you're reading this article, the chances are you've seen them. It’s the most commonly cited use for 3D printers in general education. It’s understandable, because it easily fits into traditional teaching, it's accessible to teachers of various subjects, and it's uncomplicated to implement. Unfortunately, the educational value for students is limited.\n\n**3D props are simply objects printed on a 3D printer that can be used in the context of a lesson in virtually any school subject. The prop must relate to the lesson topic.** Its objective is to bring the topic closer to students and facilitate the assimilation of knowledge, in very broad terms.\n\nThe exact impact of 3D props on the learning process is discussed in the [advantages](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#advantages) and [disadvantages](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#disadvantages) sections of this section.\n\nDuring lessons, they can be used as exhibits to view up close, passed from hand to hand, or as an integral part of tasks that students are meant solve. Even if they break by accident, no worries – just print them again.\n\n**Where do you get 3D props?** Simply search for the desired object (preferably in English) in online 3D libraries. Many models are available for free download, but for more complex ones, you often need to pay a one-time fee. We’ve listed some [interesting 3D models below](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#selected-3d-models-for-steam-lessons-we-tried-ourselves). It’s worth reading comments, checking if someone has printed a given model before, and whether they shared useful tips. Once you find the perfect candidate, download the file in STL format, load it into your slicer, and print it.\n\nVoilà! One 3D prop ready for your lesson.\n\n### Advantages\n\n#### Increased interest in the subject\n\nGadgets are cool – and gadgets used for learning are not only cool, but also useful. They spark students’ curiosity and encourage them to explore the subject further.\n\nClasses where children use extra equipment or teaching aids will always be more exciting than lessons based solely on traditional textbooks. More motivation means more effective learning – at least in the short term. Furthermore, three-dimensional props also help illustrate concepts discussed in class, showing students a new, more accessible side of the subject – one that’s literally within their reach.\n\n#### Additional stimulation\n\nEvery teacher knows that using diverse methods of conveying knowledge in class increases students' chances of remembering the lesson material. This stems from two factors: the level of stimulation and individual preferences for absorbing information.\n\nMaterial presented solely in text form will engage a limited group of students. Adding images or videos expands that group, and incorporating kinesthetic elements – things that can be touched, held in the hands, and viewed from all sides – ensures that most of the group will be actively engaged. Students will be more involved, which can positively impact how well they retain the material.\n\n#### Low production cost\n\nA classroom filled with fascinating educational accessories is a beautiful sight – especially if everyone can use those accessories. Unfortunately, many of these aids are expensive, so even if the school tightens its belt and adds them to the classroom, they may collect dust on shelves for fear of damage.\n\nPrinting your own aids avoids this issue. The only cost is the purchase of PLA filament, and from one spool you can print many different models. And if someone accidentally destroys one of the props – no problem, just print a new one!\n\nThe only catch is quality. To create high-quality accessories comparable to specialized ones, you need to invest a lot of time and personal effort in finishing them.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n(Failed 3D print)\n\n#### No contact with the 3D printer\n\nThe selection and printing of props is the teacher's responsibility. They have to go through the entire process, understand each step, and resolve any problems encountered. The student only interacts with the final result – the printed model. How the model was made doesn’t matter to them, because the goal isn’t to learn about 3D printing, but to use the model during the lesson.\n\n**In other words, educational 3D props won’t teach students anything about 3D printing or 3D design.** Students won’t see how intricate constructions gradually emerge from a modest filament, won’t experience the hardware’s limitations, won’t learn how settings affect the print, won’t get a chance to design in 3D themselves – and some may not even lay eyes on the printer.\n\nUnfortunately, if the 3D printer is used only to make props, it becomes an exclusive tool for the teacher.\n\n#### Low educational value\n\nThe educational potential of 3D printing has been loudly praised for several years, especially regarding the development of future competencies and preparation for work with advanced technologies. However, to realize such goals, students need more than printed models. Proper conditions are necessary – conditions in which students can interact with the software and hardware and begin to use them independently.\n\nOf course, creating such conditions is a challenge, especially when experience is minimal and the curriculum isn’t flexible. Nevertheless, it’s hard to shake the impression that **using a 3D printer in school solely as a mini-factory of ready-made models is a wasted opportunity**.\n\n#### Limited application\n\nIt’s important to remember that 3D printer won’t print everything. With 3D props, you can show form, structure, and proportion. However, printed models will differ from the originals in material, detail, weight, smell, often size, and flexibility.\n\nYou are also limited by the printer's build area and printing time.",
      "summary": "The chapter defines 3D props as objects printed on a 3D printer that relate to a lesson topic and can be used in virtually any school subject. It describes classroom uses such as passing props around, viewing them up close, and embedding them in student tasks, with the option to reprint if they break. It explains teachers typically select models from online 3D libraries, download STL files, and print them via a slicer, while noting advantages like increased interest, multisensory stimulation, and low PLA filament cost, alongside disadvantages such as no student contact with printing and limits from build area and print time.",

One meter of 1.75 mm PLA filament weighs about 2.98 grams, and a 1 kg spool contains approximately 335 meters.\n\n**Biology**\n\nIndeed, with a 3D printer you can print a model of an animal or plant cell and show it to students. For biology and nature lessons, you can print much more: models of internal organs, bones, or even a complete skeleton – life-sized! Of course, this requires a lot of time, and if you care about anatomical accuracy, the print settings must be perfectly calibrated.\n\n(3D printed model for school: cell)\n\nInterestingly, such models are increasingly being used at universities too, alongside real specimens.\n\n- [Plant cell](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-multi-color-mini-plant-cell-60821) ⭐⭐ – print time: 4 hr 40 min; filament: 17.5 m; other supplies: glue;\n- [Animal cell](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2803322) ⭐⭐ – print time: 4 hr; filament: 12.5 m; other supplies: glue;\n- [Human heart model](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-anatomical-heart-34709) ⭐⭐ – print time: 15 hr; filament: 13.02 m;\n- [Human skull model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4830026) ⭐⭐⭐ – print time: ~40+ hr; filament: 165 m; other supplies: glue, magnets, drill;\n\n**Mathematics**\n\n3D props can be used to illustrate math principles – especially geometry.

      "heading": "3D Design",
      "text": "## 3D Design\n\n(Student using a 3D printer)\n\nUsing a 3D printer to organize 3D design classes is a phenomenal idea – albeit an ambitious one, especially from the teacher’s perspective.\n\nDuring a 3D design lesson, students create a model in order to complete a specific task or to solve a problem. They can work on it individually or in groups, but the designing part is a solo assignment. Completed digital models are sent to the teacher, who prints them out and returns the results to the authors for testing. If necessary, students revise their designs and resubmit them for printing. The printed model makes it possible to complete the initial task.\n\n**Students solve the problem using the knowledge they’ve gained and their own ideas. They observe how the three-dimensional digital object they created transforms into a real, tangible item they can hold in their hands.** The result? A guaranteed increase in student motivation and sense of agency.\n\nThis is what a model lesson using 3D design might look like. Unfortunately, putting it into practice at school isn’t always easy – especially with technical limitations like long print times getting in the way.\n\nThere are more challenges, and good intentions alone won’t solve them all.\n\n### Advantages\n\n#### High educational value\n\nUsing a 3D printer to teach 3D design makes maximum educational use of the equipment in a school setting (whether it's a public school, a makerspace, or a STEM center). Students get a real chance to experience the possibilities of a 3D printer – even if it’s the [teacher who prints the projects](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#how-to-prepare-for-working-with-a-3d-printer).\n\nWhen designing in 3D, students must become familiar with a virtual work environment and learn how to use its many functions. It includes elements of mathematics and develops spatial imagination. The combination of design and 3D printing helps students understand the difference between a digital project and a physical print, as well as the technological limitations of 3D printing.\n\nFinally, it’s worth adding that this is a unique opportunity for a student to confront their innovative vision with reality.\n\n#### Developing future-ready competencies\n\nFuture competencies are important – especially for students. It’s hard to predict exactly what qualifications will be in demand on the job market in a dozen or so years, but 21st-century skills will certainly help future employees perform tasks in the work environment – and employers are well aware of this.\n\n**During 3D design classes, students acquire practical skills that are in demand on the global job market.** They learn the basics of 3D design, use abilities from various fields at once, work in a virtual environment, and solve complex problems. They develop independence, abstract and critical thinking, and they also get the chance to experiment and draw logical conclusions.\n\n3D design projects also build future-ready competencies tied to career and technical education (CTE), giving students early exposure to digital fabrication and problem-solving in engineering contexts.df\n\n#### Supporting creativity\n\n(Teacher using 3D printer)\n\nSociety increasingly values out-of-the-box thinking, but developing this skill at a public school is not easy. To foster creativity, one must actively create physical models. 3D design enables this – and at relatively low cost.\n\nA dedicated 3D lab isn’t necessary – a computer lab where each student works at their own desktop or laptop is enough. For materials, just a few spools of filament in different colors will do. Mistakes aren’t costly, they can be freely corrected, and models can be improved and personalized.\n\nAll of this is within reach – the only requirement is getting comfortable with the creative process in a digital environment.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n#### Specialist qualifications and experience\n\nParticipating in 3D design classes sounds magical, but conducting them is a whole different story. Not every teacher can handle it – mainly due to the required knowledge and experience.\n\nThe absolute minimum is being computer-literate at the level of confident everyday use and being open to new technologies. You don’t have to be a digital native, but basic knowledge is essential. One must get well acquainted with the design software and slicer, understand their functions, parameters, and common errors. As if that weren’t enough, the teacher must know the school’s 3D printer inside out – how to operate it, how to deal with troubleshooting, how to adjust settings to print the best possible model.\n\n**All in all, this is truly a large amount of practical knowledge, most of which you acquire by designing and working with the equipment.** It takes a lot of personal determination – and even more time.\n\n#### Lack of teaching materials\n\nThe shortage of teaching aids is another reason why special preparation is necessary to lead 3D design lessons.\n\n**So far, a universal educational path for 3D design at the primary school level had not yet been developed.** A few educational resources have been created on the topic of learning design, but mostly in the context of higher education and vocational training. Lesson plans and ideas created by other teachers can be found online, but they vary in quality, difficulty, and are made for specific conditions. They need to be reviewed, and often also modified to suit your lesson’s needs. The lack of ready-made materials means the teacher is also responsible for creating the entire curriculum practically from scratch.\n\n#### High effort, high commitment\n\n3D design classes take more time and effort than it might seem at first glance.\n\n**The teacher, apart from preparing and drafting the course plan themselves, is also responsible for operating the 3D printer – in other words, printing all the models.** Most likely after school hours. Not every print will come out right the first time; some will have to be repeated.\n\nLet's put this in real time. Assuming you’re teaching a group of 12 students and work on relatively small projects, and it takes each model an average of 2 hours to print, that’s an entire weekend with the 3D printer running. For real examples of print times, [check out the 3D Props section](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#selected-3d-models-for-steam-lessons-we-tried-ourselves) in this article.\n\nThe students don’t have it easy either. The idea of designing and printing their own toy car sounds exciting, but fine-tuning the project over several weeks so that it actually works and can be printed at all is difficult and... boring. **Long stretches of designing without tangible results become routine for kids and sap their motivation.** On the other hand, designing overly simple models is counterproductive – who would be interested in them? What problem would they help solve?\n\nBalancing between dull simplicity and unattainable virtuosity, the teacher must somehow create lessons that are both engaging and achievable at the same time.",
      "summary": "The chapter describes a 3D design lesson workflow where students create digital models to solve a task, submit them to the teacher for printing, and then test and revise designs through reprints if needed. It states students work individually or in groups but the designing part is a solo assignment, and the printed model is used to complete the initial task. The chapter lists benefits such as learning a virtual design environment, developing spatial imagination and math-related elements, and understanding digital versus physical constraints, while also noting challenges including the need for teacher expertise with software, slicers, and printer troubleshooting, and the time burden of printing many student projects (e.g., 12 students at 2 hours per model).",

      "text": "## 3D Robotics – Designing Parts for Robots\n\n(Robots with 3D printed parts designed by RoboCamp)\n\nCombining educational robotics with 3D design makes a lot of sense from both an educational and organizational standpoint. Introducing a 3D printer simultaneously enriches robotics lessons and simplifies teaching 3D design in school conditions.\n\nIt also helps overcome several of the [earlier challenges](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#disadvantages_1) and brings some unexpected **advantages to the classroom**:\n\n- Short print times, faster results\n- Simple for students, stress-free for teachers\n- No boredom, just building\n- Every lesson ends with something that works\n- Real-world skills with a future focus (CTE)\n\n**Here's how it works.** Teacher conducts a standard robotics lesson that covers introduction, building, testing, and programming the robot. In addition, students receive step by step instructions on how to design a 3D element that allows the robot to perform a special task. Once completed, 3D projects are sent to the teacher, who prints them and hands them back to the students for testing with the robot.\n\n{{ macro.embed_youtube('NCaoEN_z6fg') }}\n\nOne project might involve building and programming a butterfly out of LEGO® bricks, then designing and printing wings with a unique pattern, or one that's characteristic for a particular species.\n\nNext time, students might build a wind turbine mechanism from bricks and design a unique rotor for it in the 3D environment, which they then print and test for efficiency. Each project can be divided into several shorter lessons.\n\n#### Short printing time\n\nChildren design an element meant to solve a specific (tangible) problem outlined in the project. The complexity level of the projects is adapted to the students’ age. Since the robots are not large, the required elements are also small, which shortens printing time.\n\n#### Easy learning for students, easy prep for teacher\n\nAt each stage, both the **teacher and students have access to detailed step-by-step instructions, which makes learning the software faster and easier**, and mistakes occur less frequently. The teacher also has access to a ready-made project, which they can use if needed.\n\n#### No monotony\n\nWhat’s more, **combining robotics and 3D design prevents students’ motivation from being exhausted by problems related to aesthetics and monotony**. Designing alone can become tedious because you spend hours in a virtual environment before seeing a tangible result (which may not necessarily look the way you imagined).\n\n#### Every lesson ends with a success\n\nIn robotics with elements of design, even if the model turns out a bit crooked, the child still has an aesthetic proof of their hard work – a functioning robot. That’s something to be proud of! When design is part of a larger project, one that you partially create in a virtual environment but also build with our own hands, there’s no room for boredom.\n\n#### Developing relevant CTE skills\n\nWhat do students learn in such lessons? Programming, spatial imagination, manual skills, elements of STEAM, 3D design, problem-solving, group work, independent work, creativity... and much more.\n\n(RoboCamp robot made with LEGO bricks and 3D printed parts)\n\n**Combining robotics and 3D design is a great convenience for the teacher and an attainable way for students to use the 3D printer.** One project can be carried out over several consecutive lessons. Thanks to the multimedia step-by-step instructions, everyone knows what and how to do, which significantly simplifies learning. And once printed, you can keep the models for working with the next group.\n\nDo you think it's worth trying out with your students?\n\nAll step by step instructions, as well as downloadable models are available on the RoboCamp platform.

      "summary": "The chapter explains an approach that combines educational robotics lessons with 3D design by having students design a small 3D element that enables a robot to perform a specific task. It describes a workflow where the teacher runs a standard robotics lesson (introduction, building, testing, programming), students follow step-by-step design instructions, and the teacher prints submitted projects for students to test with the robot. The chapter gives example projects such as building and programming a butterfly out of LEGO® bricks and printing custom wings, or designing and printing a unique rotor for a wind turbine mechanism, and it links this approach to short print times due to small robot parts and to skill areas like programming, 3D design, and problem-solving.",

      "text": "## How to prepare for working with a 3D printer\n\n(Teacher operating 3D printer)\n\n3D printing in schools can be integrated in several ways – whether as a [prop-making tool](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#3d-props-for-lessons), a platform for [teaching design](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#3d-design) skills, or as [part of robotics lessons](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/blog/3d-printing-in-school/#3d-robotics-designing-parts-for-robots). Each approach comes with its own advantages and challenges. Whichever path you choose, proper preparation for working with a 3D printer is essential.\n\n#### Attend model-specific 3D printer training\n\nFirst of all, **if you get the chance, definitely take part in a training session on how to use your 3D printer.** Ideally, it should focus specifically on the model you have at school.\n\nThe training should cover all the basics: how to get the printer started, how to use the software, which settings and parameters matter, the different types of filament, and so on. After a solid training session, you should feel comfortable loading and changing filament, printing a model from a file, and even fixing small issues on your own. And of course, reading the printer’s manual won’t hurt either.\n\n#### Learn by doing: practice printing often\n\n**Training provides valuable knowledge, but you learn most by working with the equipment on our own. That’s why you should print, print, print!**\n\nDon’t wait for a pretext to use the 3D printer to appear on its own – come up with one today. Find an impressive model you want to place on your desk, level the printer bed, see how the extruder and nozzle work.\n\nAlways ensure basic safety practices, such as operating the printer in a well-ventilated area and supervising use when the equipment is heated or in motion. Sooner or later something will clog, instead of a pyramid model you’ll print spaghetti, and an error message will pop up on the screen – and each time you’ll learn something new. Remember that a 3D printer is, above all, a tool – not a showpiece – and it was made to be used.\n\n#### Start with proven educational materials\n\nOnce you’ve gotten comfortable with the printer and slicer, start with ready-made educational materials. There will be plenty of time later to bring your own creative ideas to life. **Begin with lesson plans and resources that others have already tested** (e.g. [RoboCamp lesson plan for Butterfly with 3D printed wings](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/lessons/spike-3d/)) – it’s a smart way to boost your chances of success, save time (and nerves), and get a sense of what actually works in a classroom setting. Wait to develop your own materials until you feel confident using the printer.\n\nMistakes happen and will continue to happen, but thanks to your earlier experience, you’ll know what went wrong.\n\n#### Prepare mentally: be patient, flexible, and open to help\n\nFinally, the most important thing – prepare yourself mentally. Be ready for mistakes, for not knowing things, for occasional panic, and for hours spent watching filament being laid down. **Be patient, be forgiving with yourself and with the imperfections of advanced technological equipment. Give yourself time.**\n\nBe prepared for the fact that your students – digital natives – may sometimes know more than you do, and their advice may turn out to be helpful. Appreciate their interest. Be ready for the lack of knowledge among your colleagues, who don’t use the 3D printer and don’t understand why some things just can’t be printed. Explain it to them, invite them to collaborate. Maybe they’ll help?\n\nAs you keep printing regularly, you’ll start to see real progress. Your prints will look better, you’ll feel confident enough to try more complex projects, and the fear will fade – because by then, you’ll understand how the printer works and how to handle minor hiccups on your own. You might even find yourself giving helpful tips to other teachers and students about how to get the best results. Before you know it, word gets around: you’re the school’s 3D printing expert. Congratulations!\n\nIt’s all within reach – but let’s be honest: it takes time, patience, and a good amount of motivation.\n\n[(Lesson plans for LEGO SPIKE Prime)](https://www.robocamp.eu/en/lessons/)\n\n### Sources\n\nThose who read, err less – so as part of your prep (or some evening reading), you might want to dive into research that explores 3D printing in the context of education.

The recent announcement of LEGO Education’s Computer Science & AI sets raises an important question: should AI in robotics education focus on using AI tools, or on understanding how learning algorithms actually work? Understanding how AI learns — through feedback, adaptation, and iteration — can already be taught today, even with robotics sets that many schools already have in their classrooms. One example is Launcher AI+, an advanced SPIKE Prime activity developed by the RoboCamp team. Students build a catapult-style robot that repeatedly launches a ball toward a target. After each attempt, the robot receives feedback — the shot was too short or too far — and adjusts its launch power accordingly. With every iteration, the program updates its parameters and gradually improves accuracy. There is no black-box AI here. Students design the learning logic themselves and can clearly see how data and feedback shape the robot’s behavior over time. This is what learning about AI can look like — without new hardware, and without using AI as a shortcut instead of understanding how it works. If you’d like to learn more about this approach, you’ll find additional details in the comments below. #robocamp #LEGOEducation #SPIKEprime #STEM #STEMEducation #stemforkids #edtech #AIinEducation #machinelearningeducation

LEGO® Education has announced a new Computer Science & AI product line and, at the same time, shared an update regarding the retirement of SPIKE Prime and SPIKE Essential. For schools already working with SPIKE sets, the following confirmed timelines are particularly important: – SPIKE Prime and SPIKE Essential will remain available for purchase at least until mid-2026, – spare parts for SPIKE Prime and SPIKE Essential will be available until June 2028, – software for SPIKE will remain supported until June 2031. This means that the well-established SPIKE Prime and SPIKE Essential sets will continue to be reliable, long-term educational tools for many years to come. As for the new Computer Science & AI sets — at this stage, it is simply too early to evaluate them. We don’t form opinions until we have had the opportunity to work hands-on with the sets and test them in real classroom conditions. We will publish a full review of the new sets after proper testing. In the meantime, we invite you to read our review of LEGO Education Science. Since the new Computer Science & AI line is based on the same generation of electronic components, it is currently the best available reference point for understanding the direction LEGO Education is heading with its future educational products. Link to the review in the comments. #robocamp #LEGOEducation #SPIKEprime #SPIKEEssential #educationalrobotics #STEM #stemeducation #stemforkids #edtech

💙 6 lat wspólnej pracy i ciągle nowe wyzwania! Wasz rozwój motywuje nas do tworzenia coraz lepszych scenariuszy lekcji. Bardzo cieszy nas, że do pracy z zestawami SPIKE Prime włączacie również druk 3D i ploter laserowy. Pokazujecie w praktyce, że lekcje robotyki nie kończą się na tym, co jest w pudełku – jedynym ograniczeniem jest wyobraźnia ✨ #RoboCamp #LEGOEducation #SPIKEPrime #EducationalRobotics #STEMEducation #3DPrinting #Tinkercad #3DDesign

🚀 3D Printing for Robotics – Unlimited Potential or Unnecessary Complication? At RoboCamp, you'll find lesson plans that incorporate 3D-printed components, specifically designed to unlock the full potential of LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime. ✅ On one hand – unlimited creative freedom! Design and print exactly what you need. The only limit is your imagination! ⚠️ On the other hand – logistical challenges. You need access to a 3D printer and must allocate time for printing, which doesn't always go smoothly. ➡️ What do you think? Would you utilize a 3D printer in this way? Is it a fantastic method to enhance robotics classes, or is it too much trouble? 💬 Share your thoughts – your opinions are invaluable to us!

Snake and Arkanoid in Python? Build them yourself with SPIKE Prime! 🤖🕹️ Remember playing Snake on your first mobile phone? Or spending hours with Arkanoid on an old computer? For many of us, these games were our very first step into the digital world – first as players, then as programmers, and today as educators. At RoboCamp, we now give kids the chance to experience something similar. Only this time — from the other side of the screen. As part of our SPIKE Prime Programming Course Expert, students create their own versions of these classic games using LEGO kits and the Python programming language.🔧🧠💻 It’s not just fun. It’s: ✅ hands-on coding in Python, ✅ learning how game mechanics work, ✅ exploring the history of gamedev through experience. Why do we teach kids to program Snake and Arkanoid? Because that’s how our own tech journey began. Those pixelated games sparked our curiosity and made us ask: How does it work? Could I build this myself? Now it’s the kids’ turn. We give them the tools — and they become the creators. Python. Robots. The classics of gamedev. All ready — in our expert-level course. Join us on this journey from pixels to robots! 💾➡️🤖 #RoboCamp #LEGOEducation #SPIKEPrime #PythonForKids #EducationalRobotics #STEMEducation
